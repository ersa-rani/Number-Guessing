Number Guessing Game 🎯🐍

A simple number guessing game built using Python!

🔹 How the Game Works?

✔ The program generates a random number between 50 to 100.
✔ The player gets 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
✔ After each incorrect guess, the program provides hints:

"Too high!" ⬆ if the guess is greater than the actual number.

"Too low!" ⬇ if the guess is lower than the actual number.
✔ If guessed correctly, 🎉 Congratulations!
✔ If the player runs out of attempts, ❌ the correct number is revealed.


🎯 What I Learned?

✅ Using Python’s random module for number generation.
✅ Implementing loops & conditions for better interactivity.
✅ Improving user experience with hints and attempt tracking.

🚀 Future Improvements

🔹 Adding difficulty levels (Easy/Hard) to enhance gameplay.
